### Performance of Code

This repository is a companion for a [Turing lesson on profiling
code performance](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/performance_of_code.markdown)

It includes several examples, including:

#### performance_of_code.rb

This file contains some example code snippets for you to experiment with
benchmarking basic ruby code

#### car.rb

This file contains a simple object-oriented model of a car. Experiment
with profiling it using the built-in ruby profiler:

`ruby -rprofile car.rb`

#### fib.rb

This file contains an implementation of the fibonacci sequence. Try
profiling it as well:

`ruby -rprofile fib.rb`
