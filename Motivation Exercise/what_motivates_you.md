#When do you hit your most unconscious flow, where your actions happen almost automatically?
  *when i am coding and have some idea of what I am supposed to accoumplish.  I seem to lose track of time and
  just get involved in solving the problem.  usually after I get started and work for a half hour to an hour
#Are there any dangers, problems, or weaknesses with that flow state? Is it healthy?
  *the dangers that I see with that flow state are sometimes going down allys that do not lead to the final goal.
  It is easy to get lost solving a problem that does not relate.  Sometimes you spend a bunch of time trying to
  figure something out and then you finally do and realize that you probably wont use what you just learned again
  and that what you did to find out was trivial in the end.  Sometimes checking where you are and where you are going
  is a healthy choice.  Usually at night after coding all day is when i hit an unconcious work flow and it starts to get late
  before I know it.  It could be unhealthy because I do not go to bed at an early time.
#What motivates you to work? Why are you here at Turing, in the big picture, and why are you here today in the small?
  What motivates me to work is the need to make money...I am at turing in the big picture because I know that I can make the life I want with
  the tools and skills that I learn at Turing
#What's the purpose behind your motivation? We all have a need for survival, but you likely aspire to leave some kind of mark. What is it? Why?
  The purpose behind the motivation is to be something other than what everyone esle does.  To be able to do things that others are not able
  to do. Like working from home or remote places that you typicaly could not live if you had a normal job.
#What undercuts your motivation? When do you struggle to focus or achieve? What excuses do you use to make it ok to fail or procrastinate?
  
#What helps you do your best work? Why not do these things all the time?
